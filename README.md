# SOA_Practica
In this repo we try to read file systems in c. We divided the project in 4 phases;: <br>
* Phase 1:<br> Info: displays the information of FAT16 and et2 filesystems<br>

in order to execute the program run make on FASE_X and execute the command ./shooter <operacio> <nom_volum><br>
  \<operacio\> -> /info <br>
  \<nom_volum\> -> The filename of the volume that you want to inspect
